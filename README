inetkami - infobot for twitter
====================================================================

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Infobots have a long history and tradition on IRC.  This is sort of 
the equivalent for twitter, optimized for information one might
like to get while travelling in a form that's usable via an
SMS-enabled non-smartphone.


Rationale
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Why does this exist in the smartphone era?  Well, here in small-town
Canada we're saddled with a de-facto monopoly of incumbent wireless 
providers.  Data rates are absurdly expensive, and public wifi is 
extremely spotty.  It's common, however, to have a mobile plan with
unlimited SMS.  With twitter as a bridge, then, one can devise
a service that efficiently lets you tap into some of the bits you 
might want to know while you're out and about, without having to
remortgage your house to pay for a data plan.  

Being able to efficiently query things via your twitter account on 
your laptop, desktop, or smartphone is a nice side effect, as is
being able to share the results easily.


Why the name?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In Shinto, kami are the spirits that live in the natural objects
and things all around us: mountains, trees, lakes, rivers; even 
extraordinary animals and people.  They can be baleful, but also
helpful, especially to people who're aware of and respectful of 
them.  Thus, the "internet kami" seemed like an appropriate metaphor 
for the helpful spirits that live in the internets. ^_^
